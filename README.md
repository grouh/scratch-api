# scratch-api
A light API with no dependencies

What is missing (and I wish i did)
* a light authentification for basic security
* a better way to deal with arguments and clean them
* a better SCM abstraction
* model classes for manipulation
* basic unit testing

Doing with with dependencies, I would have either used
* API platorm, quite heavy solution but provide out of the box the API and manipulation, all you need is to create your entities (almost)
* Silex and Doctrine for the features, Monolog and PHPUnit for tooling
